# 3D Printed Optics Lab Components

This repository contains STL and PNG files for various components designed and created by Vladislav Stolbennikov as part of a research project aimed at reducing the costs of Modern Optics labs through 3D printing. 
These components serve as replacements for typically expensive parts used in optics experiments.

## Project Overview

Started in October 2023, this research focuses on creating affordable alternatives to commercial optics lab equipment. The goal is to provide high-quality, functional parts that can be easily reproduced with a 3D printer.

### Current Progress

I have successfully created several replacement parts for expensive optics equipment, including but not limited to:
- Post Mount
- Post
- Fixed Lens Mount
- Adjustable Mirror Mount
- Cube Cage
- Right-Angle post Clamps
- Micrososcope Objective Lens Mount
- Linear Translation Stage
- Rotation Stage

Currently, I am working on developing a precision Rotation Stage with a 1:21600 gear ratio.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by the name of the component. Each component includes a picture of it as a .png file and all of that components parts as .stl files.

## Usage Instructions

This repository should be used in conjenction with the 3D-Printing and Optics Research Manual

### 3D Printing

1. Download the desired STL file from the `STL` directory.
2. Load the STL file into your 3D printer's slicing software.
3. Adjust print settings as needed (material type, layer height, infill, etc.).
4. Print the component.

### Viewing Previews

To get a visual preview of the components before printing, refer to the corresponding .png files.
